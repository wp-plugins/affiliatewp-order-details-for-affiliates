Allow affiliates to see order details on referrals they generated.

== Description ==

> This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") in order to function.

This add-on adds a new area to the affiliateâ€™s dashboard that allows a logged-in affiliate to see specific information about the order that their referral generated. Currently it works with both Easy Digital Downloads and WooCommerce. 

**Features:**

1. Affiliates can see order details for each referral they generated from their affiliate dashboard
1. Globally enable access to the order details for all affiliates
1. Enable access on a per-affiliate level to the order details
1. Send an email to the affiliate with the order details included
1. Disable specific information from showing to the affiliate

The following details can be shown an affiliate who has access:

1. Order Number
1. Order Date
1. Order Total
1. Referral Amount
1. Customer Name
1. Customer Email
1. Customer Phone (only available in WooCommerce)
1. Customer Shipping Address
1. Customer Billing Address

These can also be easily turned off via a simple filter (see FAQ tab). In addition to disabling the information that is shown, you can customize the layout by editing the `dashboard-tab-order-details.php` template file from your child theme.

The affiliate will also be emailed these details at the time the referral was created.
